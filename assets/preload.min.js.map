It helps to enable those entering and \\n                    exiting the dark performance space before the main lights have been turned on or after they have been shut off. The ghost light \\n                    origin is shrouded in many superstitions, from stories of appeasing theatre ghosts to more practical explanations of avoiding \\n                    pressure build up in gas lines before the advent of electricity, but the modern application is one of safety and guidance.</p>\\n                <p>In our journey of starting a training program for performers of all ages, types, and skill levels, the ghost light revealed itself \\n                    as a comforting and universal symbol of what it is to be a performer. There is always a light on in the theatre. There is always \\n                    energy in the space. There is always work to be done and discoveries to be made, even when the house is closed. For this reason, \\n                    we chose to take this hauntingly appropriate image as our mascot.</p>\\n                <p>Through our training program, we seek to enrich, educate, and prepare performers to further their artistic endeavors and careers by \\n                    offering training, management, and the tools to succeed in the professional industry. We strive to create a foundation of freedom \\n                    and discipline, fun and instruction, emotional safety and artistic daring, an environment that reflects the nature of the \\n                    entertainment industry itself. We hope to develop actors and models who not only shine when the show is in full swing, but also \\n                    keep their light ablaze when preparing quietly on their own for that next big performance.</p>\\n                <p>We are Ghost Light Performance, Inc.
