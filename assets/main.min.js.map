He is also the grandson of the Yang clan leader, Lee Chao Yang. Holding his family's title in honoring and obeying their rules within the Hmong culture has truly held his leadership role. Coming from a tribal group, \\u201CHMONG,\\u201D his family has come a long way from Laos into America. There are only 18 clan groups within the Hmong community, where many have branched out to Minnesota, North Carolina, France, Sacramento, and Fresno just to name a few. Fresno was where a majority of his relatives and family resided after the Vietnam War. Life in Fresno was quite a challenging path for his family and him, but they managed to get through with the help of succeeding in education and talent. Yang is currently attending CSU, Fresno getting his degree in Fashion Merchandising and getting a minor in Theatre Arts: Drama.\\nFashion has always been with Yang. When he was 4 years old, he would cut his sister's clothes that she did not want anymore and pin them on the dolls. The dolls were like his dress forms, where he would style them in multiple fabrics. Growing up, you will always get an idea of what you wish to pursue as a career and start experimenting with it. Today, Yang is living his dream as a fashion designer working with clients and doing fashion shows. He did not start sewing until late September of 2011. Yang created a mini hunter-green dress for a friend of his for her 19th birthday. From that weekend, Yang knew that he was capable of designing and constructing garments.\\nSome designers go to a design school for the training, but Yang is a self-taught designer from scratch behind production. With the help of his dress form, he would geometrically measure and estimate how much fabric he would need to make the top and bottom. His first collection was showcased on April 28, 2012 with Fashion Inc.'s 2nd Annual Fashion Show, \\u201CHollywood Vintage.\\u201D Later in the year, he participated with \\u201CRevived Fashion Show,\\u201D at the Hmong International New Year. His most recent shows were all in April of 2013, where he participated in San Francisco's \\u201CiCu Fashion Show/ Networking Industry,\\u201D \\u201CTrashique\\u201D at the Fresno Art Museum, Fashion Inc.'s 3rd Annual Fashion Show, \\u201COnce Upon a Spring,\\u201D Hmong Music Festival's \\u201CSew Into the Beat,\\u201D Fely Tchaco's \\u201CModern Ethnic in the Spotlight Fashion Show\\u201D in San Francisco, and also showcased his first menswear collection at the Revived 3 Fashion Show at The Grand in Downtown Fresno.\\nAs far as theatre arts and entertainment goes, Yang has performed in Roger Rocka's Dinner Theatre in shows such as \\u201CThe Drowsy Chaperone\\u201D (2011) - Ensemble, \\u201CThe King and I\\u201D (2014) - Prince Chululongkorn, and \\u201CWest Side Story\\u201D (2014) - Luis. Yang is currently signed with All American Rascals Talent Agency in Southern California and is currently SAG (Screen Actors Guild) eligible. In the summer of 2013, Yang booked his first job as a featured dancer on ABC Family's \\u201CPretty Little Liars,\\u201D season 4 episode 11. A month later, he booked another job with Nickelodeon's \\u201CThe Thundermans,\\u201D season 1 episode 7 also as a featured dancer.\\nYang's biggest influence would have to be his mother and aunt. Growing up in a very traditional family, Yang has always wanted to make his family proud of his accomplishments. His mother gave him the basics of sewing. She is an extremely hard worker and does not stop what she is doing until she finishes. Yang's aunt is a powerful woman who always believed in her words and in Yang. Her message to Yang was, \\u201CGreat accomplishments come to those who put a lot of effort and dedication into their work.\\u201D His main logo design is, \\u201CBY Design,\\u201D which stands for \\u201CBe Youthful, Be Yourself, by Brandon Yang.\\u201D It stands for you as an individual wearing what you want and feel. There is nothing wrong with who you are or what you wear, because it represents the power of who you are.\\nAside from coaching modeling/ runway, Yang enjoys keeping up to date with fashion, browsing through the internet, eating, shopping, traveling, networking, trying to make time for his friends and family, and trying to get most of his sleep in with his chaotic schedule.\"\n}];\nexports.team = team;\nvar workshops = [{\n  id: 1,\n  title: 'Intro to Performance',\n  subtitle: 'Acting & Modeling',\n  pitch: \"New performers will develop basic techniques in commercial acting and modeling, sharpen important practical skills in auditioning and interviewing, and learn how to present themselves as professionals throughout the performance process.\",\n  description: \"The Introductory Workshop Series is designed with the new performer in mind.
