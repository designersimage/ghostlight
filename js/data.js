        title: 'Modeling Coach',
        headshot: 'headshot_yang.jpg',
        bio: `<p>Brandon Yang was born and raised in Fresno, California to Chu Ning Yang and Kay Xiong. He is also the grandson of 
        the Yang clan leader, Lee Chao Yang. Holding his family's title in honoring and obeying their rules within the Hmong culture 
        has truly held his leadership role. Coming from a tribal group, “HMONG,” his family has come a long way from Laos into America. 
        There are only 18 clan groups within the Hmong community, where many have branched out to Minnesota, North Carolina, France, 
        Sacramento, and Fresno just to name a few. Fresno was where a majority of his relatives and family resided after the Vietnam War. 
        Life in Fresno was quite a challenging path for his family and him, but they managed to get through with the help of succeeding 
        in education and talent. Yang is currently attending CSU, Fresno getting his degree in Fashion Merchandising and getting a minor 
        in Theatre Arts: Drama.</p>
        <p>Fashion has always been with Yang. When he was 4 years old, he would cut his sister's clothes that she did not want anymore and 
        pin them on the dolls. The dolls were like his dress forms, where he would style them in multiple fabrics. Growing up, you will 
        always get an idea of what you wish to pursue as a career and start experimenting with it. Today, Yang is living his dream as a 
        fashion designer working with clients and doing fashion shows. He did not start sewing until late September of 2011. Yang created 
        a mini hunter-green dress for a friend of his for her 19th birthday. From that weekend, Yang knew that he was capable of designing 
        and constructing garments.</p>
        <p>Some designers go to a design school for the training, but Yang is a self-taught designer from scratch behind production. With the 
        help of his dress form, he would geometrically measure and estimate how much fabric he would need to make the top and bottom. His 
        first collection was showcased on April 28, 2012 with Fashion Inc.'s 2nd Annual Fashion Show, “Hollywood Vintage.” Later in the year, 
        he participated with “Revived Fashion Show,” at the Hmong International New Year. His most recent shows were all in April of 2013, 
        where he participated in San Francisco's “iCu Fashion Show/ Networking Industry,” “Trashique” at the Fresno Art Museum, Fashion Inc.'s 
        3rd Annual Fashion Show, “Once Upon a Spring,” Hmong Music Festival's “Sew Into the Beat,” Fely Tchaco's “Modern Ethnic in the 
        Spotlight Fashion Show” in San Francisco, and also showcased his first menswear collection at the Revived 3 Fashion Show at The Grand 
        in Downtown Fresno.</p>
        <p>As far as theatre arts and entertainment goes, Yang has performed in Roger Rocka's Dinner Theatre in shows such as “The Drowsy 
        Chaperone” (2011) - Ensemble, “The King and I” (2014) - Prince Chululongkorn, and “West Side Story” (2014) - Luis. Yang is currently 
        signed with All American Rascals Talent Agency in Southern California and is currently SAG (Screen Actors Guild) eligible. In the 
        summer of 2013, Yang booked his first job as a featured dancer on ABC Family's “Pretty Little Liars,” season 4 episode 11. A month 
        later, he booked another job with Nickelodeon's “The Thundermans,” season 1 episode 7 also as a featured dancer.</p>
        <p>Yang's biggest influence would have to be his mother and aunt. Growing up in a very traditional family, Yang has always wanted to 
        make his family proud of his accomplishments. His mother gave him the basics of sewing. She is an extremely hard worker and does not 
        stop what she is doing until she finishes. Yang's aunt is a powerful woman who always believed in her words and in Yang. Her message 
        to Yang was, “Great accomplishments come to those who put a lot of effort and dedication into their work.” His main logo design is, 
        “BY Design,” which stands for “Be Youthful, Be Yourself, by Brandon Yang.” It stands for you as an individual wearing what you want 
        and feel. There is nothing wrong with who you are or what you wear, because it represents the power of who you are.</p>
        <p>Aside from coaching modeling/ runway, Yang enjoys keeping up to date with fashion, browsing through the internet, eating, shopping, 
        traveling, networking, trying to make time for his friends and family, and trying to get most of his sleep in with his chaotic schedule.</p>`

        description: `The Intermediate Acting Series is geared toward strengthening and deepening the 
                actor’s understanding of the craft by working with a partner on a two-person scene. The 
                Intermediate course does require additional outside work between scene partners, and is 
                therefore designed not only to enhance the performer’s artistic skills, but to also develop 
                his or her confidence in cooperating with another performer.`,
