                        <p>At Ghost Light Performance, Inc., we believe that having the right tools is just as important as having the right 
                            training when it comes to building a successful acting or modeling career. For this reason, we emphasize the inclusion 
                            of Headshots and Portfolio Pictures, Video Reels and Comp Cards, Resume Creation and Interview Training in our workshop 
                            series. Each series will help to contribute not only the performer's artistic abilities but also to his or her business 
                            savvy and accumulated evidence of work. These tools are vital when auditioning, networking, and seeking representation. 
                            We strive to prepare our performers to shine both on stage and on the business end of the industry. Please see the 
                            individual workshop series for which tools each includes.
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Headshots:</strong> A headshot is an 8"x10" picture of an actor or model's face, particularly one expressing 
                                character and personality. Headshots should be dynamic and engaging to the professionals to whom they will be submitted 
                                and capable of grabbing the attention of an agent, manager, or casting director. Typically these pictures are from 
                                shoulders up only, as the name implies.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Portfolio:</strong> A portfolio is a collection of images displaying the very best of a model's print work. 
                                It should contain between six and twenty pictures in a variety of styles and poses demonstrating the model's personality, 
                                versatility, and strengths. The sizes of a portfolio should be between 8"x10" and 9"x14", depending on the specific market.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Reel:</strong> An actor's reel is a video, no more than three minutes in length, that shows his or her experience 
                                in film. It includes one to five scenes of varied lengths and acting ranges, and sometimes includes a montage of thirty 
                                seconds or less. It is designed to showcase an actor's talent as well as encourage an agent, manager, or director to sign, 
                                cast, or hire the performer.
                            </li>
                            <li><strong>Comp Card:</strong> Short for "composite card," a comp card is an 8.5"x5.5" presentation of the newest and best 
                                images an actor or model has available, typically including a large headshot on one side and three to five smaller images 
                                on the reverse. The comp card is valuable in showing a performer's range by presenting an agent, manager, or casting 
                                director with a variety of looks and styles.
                            </li>
